# ConstraintSolver.jl

This package aims to be a constraint solver written in Julia and will be documented completely on my blog [OpenSourc.es](https://opensourc.es/blog/constraint-solver-1)

In general it's the goal to be as fast as possible but also as a teaching project on how one can do such a project by himself.
I'm just a MSc student in computer science so I don't have much knowledge on how constraint programming works but I'm keen to find out ;)
